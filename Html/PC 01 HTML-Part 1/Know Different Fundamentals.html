    <h1>COMPUTER SCIENCE FUNDAMENTALS</h1>

    <h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
    <p>Computer Science Fundamentals is a 6-credit hour course offered by the department. This is a project-intensive course that covers computer programming and fundamental computer science.</p>
    <p>If you do not have an undergraduate degree in computer science, you must complete this course. Computer Science Fundamentals starts you on your journey towards your formal master’s program. You can waive it if you pass a proficiency exam offered the week before classes start. Students will have the choice of using either C, C++, or Java to solve the proficiency exam questions.</p>
    <p>Students who are successful in this course go on to succeed in their master’s degree program. They have cutting edge knowledge in computer science coupled with excellent programming skills. This provides them with excellent job opportunities in the future.</p>

    <h3>Data Structure and Algorithms:</h3>
    <p>A computer program is a collection of instructions to perform a specific task. For this, a computer program may need to store data, retrieve data, and perform computations on the data.</p>
    <p>A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.
